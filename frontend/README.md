# Getting Started with the Frontend

First and foremost, make sure you have installed a recent version of node and npm. In order to do this, [download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the steps, and make sure it's installed by running `node -v` and `npm -v`. 

Next, clone the repository wherever you'd like and `cd` into the `frontend` folder. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. After this, you can type `npm start` to launch to development server at `localhost:3000`, by default.

If you encounter any errors or need any further help getting set up, feel free to ping someone and ask.
